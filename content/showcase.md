I've made some game servers, most of which are still running but are private.  
The public ones, for now (_could already be private by the time someone reads this_):
  - [VCMP](vcmp://65.2.65.211:8192)
  - CSGO
  - MTA:SA

Aside from game servers, I've mostly done analysis on publicly available datasets, so there's not much to show here.  

Most of my other stuff is available for everyone to view at either [Github](https://github.com/theKAKAN) or [my private Gitea server](https://git.kakan.omg.lol).
Well, not like there's much to see either way...

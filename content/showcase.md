I've made some game servers, most of which are still running but are private.  
The public ones, for now (_could already be private by the time someone reads this_):
  - [VCMP](vcmp://vcmp.gboyz.xyz:8192)
  - CSGO at [csgo.gboyz.xyz:27015](csgo.gboyz.xyz:27015)
  - MTA:SA

Aside from game servers, I've mostly done analysis on publicly available datasets, so there's not much to show here.  

There are also a few more projects that I would like to try, but as of now, I'm doing my best to familiarise myself with the OSS world. 
That includes contributing in various non-code formats, like creating issues or taking part in discussions.  

Most of that can be found in GitHub, GitLab and specific git servers related to various projects (_like GNOME_)

Most of my other stuff is available for everyone to view at either [Github](https://github.com/theKAKAN) or [my private Gitea server](https://git.kakan.omg.lol).

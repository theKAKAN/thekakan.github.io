Things I'm most comfortable with:
 - Languages: Python, PHP, TS/JS, Java, C/C++, Bash and Lua
 - Frameworks: Laravel(_PHP_), React, Vue, Svelte(_TS/JS_) and have used many more
 - Databases: PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, MySQL
 - Other tech: Docker/Podman, Ansible

I'm currently learning and very much interested in automation libraries, like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and container orchestration like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

I also use many different cloud services. However, I'm most familar with:
 - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
 - [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
 - [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/257cf65ea05c) (Referral Link)
 - [Linode]()

Currently, I'm trying out [Oracle Cloud](https://cloud.oracle.com/), mostly because of their generous free tier. It's very attractive, as a student.

I have tried different BaaS options including:
 - [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
 - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
 - [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) (_This website is hosted on Cloudflare Pages btw_)

...and self-hosted ones like:
 - [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
 - [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/)


Aside from the skills I learnt, I've made some game servers, most of which are still running but are private.  
The public ones, for now (_could already be private by the time someone reads this_):
  - [VCMP](vcmp://vcmp.gboyz.xyz:8192)
  - CSGO at [csgo.gboyz.xyz:27015](csgo.gboyz.xyz:27015)
  - MTA:SA

I also love to self host projects, and currently, I'm self-hosting:
  - [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)
  - [The Lounge](https://thelounge.chat/)
  - [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)
  - [Paperless](https://paperless-ng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - Various telegram & discord bots

I'm looking forward to try and manage public servers for [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), but I've not done it yet.  
For now, only my [The Lounge](https://irc.kakan.omg.lol) is accessible to the public, along with the game servers.  

Aside from game servers and self-hosting, I've mostly done analysis on publicly available datasets, so there's not much to show here. However, most of it was done using a combination of Python, Numpy, Pandas and SQLAlchemy.  

There are also a few more projects that I would like to try, but as of now, I'm doing my best to familiarise myself with the OSS world. 
That includes contributing in various non-code formats, like creating issues or taking part in discussions.  

Most of that can be found in GitHub, GitLab and specific git servers related to various projects (_like GNOME_)

Most of my other stuff is available for everyone to view at either [Github](https://github.com/theKAKAN) or [my private Gitea server](https://git.kakan.omg.lol).

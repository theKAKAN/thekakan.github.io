I was running Lighthouse test on this website, and aside from getting a lower than expected score due to images, I noticed one other thing: There was nothing said in the PWA section.  

Before this, I did know that PWAs existed, and I always loved them. But, they mostly included interactive applications and I doubted if a static page could have one. So, I googled.  

The result? Indeed, they can and some do.

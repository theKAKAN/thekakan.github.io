# Hi There!

I go by KAKAN (_He/Him_)

...or Hazel, based on one of my favourite characters and claimed eye colour.

I'm a student who likes playing with data, aiming to be a backend dev.  
I like meeting with new people and learning new stuff!  


_It's fun!_

While I am studying at a university, I'm mostly self-taught. I also make game
 servers, for fun and experience.

I'm not a big fan of ~~Facebook~~ Meta, but I've quite a few socials that you
 can find at [Contact Me](/contact-me) page


_Oh! By the way, I love Foxes!_


Well, there's that. Moving on to more interesting things, I'm interested in
 trying out different technical solutions for web. This site is made using
 [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/),
 and for the most part, written using a text editor [Sublime Text 4](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
 rather than a WSYIWYG editor. Time will tell if this works out for me.  



Hope you liked this website and my introduction.

See ya soon!

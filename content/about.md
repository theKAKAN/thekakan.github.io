# Hi There

I go by Hazel

...or KAKAN, meaning cookie.

I'm a student as well as a data nerd, aiming to be a backend dev.  
I'm quite shy, but I like socialising with new people and learning new stuff!  

_It's exciting!_

While I am studying at a university, I'm mostly self-taught. I also make game
 servers, for fun and experience.

I'm not a big fan of ~~Facebook~~ Meta, but I've quite a few socials that you
 can find at [Contact Me](/contact-me) page


_Oh! By the way, I love Foxes!_


Well, there's that. Moving on to more interesting things, I'm interested in
 trying out different technical solutions for web. This site is made using
 [Hugo]() and hosted using [Github Pages](),
 and for the most part, written using a text editor [Sublime Text 4]()
 rather than a WSYIWYG editor. Time will tell if this works out for me.  



Hope you liked this website and my (_probably_) really bad introduction.

See ya!
